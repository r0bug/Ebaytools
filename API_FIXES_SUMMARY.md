# eBay Tools API Fixes Summary

## Changes Made to Fix LLM API Errors

### 1. Enhanced API Response Parsing (`ebay_tools/ebay_tools/core/api.py`)

#### Problem
The API response parsing was failing because different LLM providers (Segmind, OpenAI, Claude) return responses in different formats, and the code wasn't handling all variations properly.

#### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Improved API Type Detection**
   - Added specific detection for Segmind-hosted APIs (segmind-claude, segmind-llava)
   - Better differentiation between API providers based on URL patterns

2. **Enhanced Response Text Extraction**
   - Added support for multiple response field names: "response", "output", "text", "generated_text", "completion", "answer", "result"
   - Added fallback mechanisms to try common field names
   - Better handling of string responses (some APIs return plain strings)
   - Added specific handling for Segmind API response formats

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added JSON parsing error handling with fallback to raw text
   - Added validation to check for empty responses
   - Improved error messages with more context

4. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
   - Added debug logging for raw API responses
   - Added request/response logging for troubleshooting
   - Created separate log file (`ebay_api_debug.log`) for API debugging
   - Environment variable `DEBUG_API=true` enables verbose logging

### 2. Fixed API Request Payload Formats

#### Problem
Different APIs expect different payload structures, especially for image data.

#### Solutions:
1. **Segmind-specific Payload Formats**
   - Segmind uses "image" field instead of "images" for image data
   - Added proper max_tokens and temperature parameters
   - Different payload structures for text-only vs multimodal requests

2. **API-specific Headers**
   - Maintained proper authentication headers for each API type
   - OpenAI uses "Authorization: Bearer" while others use "x-api-key"

### 3. Created Diagnostic Test Script (`test_api_connection.py`)

A comprehensive test script that:
- Tests basic text generation
- Tests image processing (if image provided)
- Tests rate limiting functionality
- Tests error handling with invalid API keys
- Provides detailed debugging output
- Can save working configurations

### Usage Instructions

1. **To test your API connection:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_api_connection.py
   ```

2. **To enable debug logging when running the processor:**
   ```bash
   export DEBUG_API=true
   python3 ebay_tools/ebay_tools/apps/processor.py
   ```

3. **To check API debug logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f ebay_api_debug.log
   ```

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **Segmind API Response Format**
   - Segmind APIs often return responses in `{"output": "..."}` format
   - Some return plain strings instead of JSON objects
   - Fixed by adding multiple fallback mechanisms

2. **Empty Response Handling**
   - Added validation to ensure responses contain actual content
   - Better error messages when responses are empty

3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Improved rate limiting to prevent 429 errors
   - Added exponential backoff for retries

### Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify your API connection
2. Check the debug logs if you encounter issues
3. The fixes should handle most common API response formats
4. If you still have issues, the debug logs will show the exact response format
