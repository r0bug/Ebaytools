# eBay Pricing Research Guide

## Overview

The eBay Tools v3.0.0 includes professional research capabilities that help users navigate the current eBay API landscape while maintaining full compliance with eBay's Terms of Service.

## Current eBay API Landscape (2024-2025)

As documented in our comprehensive [eBay API Technical Guide](EBAY_API_COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.md), the eBay data access landscape has fundamentally changed:

- **findCompletedItems API**: Decommissioned February 5, 2025
- **Marketplace Insights API**: Requires business partnership approval (most applications rejected)
- **Traditional web scraping**: Prohibited by eBay Terms of Service
- **LLM automation**: Still violates eBay ToS regardless of sophistication

## Professional Research Tools

### 1. Manual Verification Workflows

The Price Analyzer now provides proper eBay search URLs for manual research:

#### Sold Listings Research
- **Purpose**: Analyze completed sales for pricing insights
- **URL Format**: Includes LH_Sold=1 and LH_Complete=1 parameters
- **Filters**: Price range, date range (last 30/90 days), condition
- **Access**: Click "Open eBay Sold Listings" button in Research Tools tab

#### Current Listings Research  
- **Purpose**: Assess current market competition
- **URL Format**: Standard eBay search without sold filters
- **Filters**: Price range, condition, seller type
- **Access**: Click "Open eBay Current Listings" button in Research Tools tab

### 2. Research Checklists

Structured 7-step manual research process:

1. **Open eBay sold listings URL in browser**
2. **Review first 2-3 pages of sold items**
3. **Note price range and average selling price**
4. **Check shipping costs and total prices**
5. **Identify seasonal patterns if visible**
6. **Check current listings for competition**
7. **Document findings in research template**

#### Data Collection Points
- Average sold price
- Price range (min/max)
- Number of listings sold per page
- Common conditions sold
- Shipping cost patterns
- Competition level assessment

#### Red Flags to Watch
- Very few sold listings
- Wide price variations
- Many "for parts" listings
- Seasonal items out of season

### 3. Research Template Export

The system generates structured JSON templates for documentation:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T...",
  "product": "vintage watch",
  "search_terms": "vintage rolex submariner",
  "research_method": "manual_verification",
