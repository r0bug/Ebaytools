- The installer will report exactly which dependencies failed

## Migration from Old Installer

If you previously used `install.bat` (the old installer):

1. **Your data is safe** - queues, exports, configs are preserved
2. **Run the new installer** - it will detect and backup the old installation  
3. **Use new shortcuts** - delete old desktop shortcuts and use the new ones
4. **All features will work** - Reset button, version display, latest code

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check installer output** - it provides detailed diagnostic information
2. **Look for backup folder** - your old installation is saved as `ebay_tools_backup/`
3. **Re-run installer** - it's safe to run multiple times and fixes most issues
4. **Report specific error messages** from the installer diagnostic output

## What Makes These Installers Different

### Old `install.bat`:
- ❌ Only installed dependencies
- ❌ Didn't copy/update code files  
- ❌ No verification of features

### New Complete Installers:
- ✅ **Install complete code base every time**
- ✅ **Verify all features work** (Reset button, version, etc.)
- ✅ **Handle updates automatically** with backup
- ✅ **Test everything** before declaring success
- ✅ **Platform-optimized** for Windows, Linux, macOS

**Result**: No more "missing features" or "unknown version" issues!
